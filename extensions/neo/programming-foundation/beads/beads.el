;;; Commentary:

;; beads.el provides an Emacs interface to the Beads issue tracking system.
;; Beads is a Git-backed, AI-native issue tracker that stores data in `.beads/`
;; and communicates with a daemon via Unix socket RPC.
;;
;; Usage:
;;   M-x beads  - Open the Beads issue list
;;
;; The client automatically discovers the Beads database by walking up from
;; `default-directory` looking for `.beads/beads.db`, then connects to the
;; daemon socket (e.g. `.beads/bd.sock`).  Multiple CLI backends are supported
;; (bd, br) and auto-detected per project; see `beads-cli-program'.
;;
;; You can use beads.el on multiple projects at the same time.
;;
;; Make sure to try:
;;
;; - Transient menu to discover all user-facing functions, including
;;   the various ways to edit parts of an issue, or the whole issue
;;   at once in a form.
;; - Preview mode, where you can 'peek' at issue details as you move
;;   point in the list.
